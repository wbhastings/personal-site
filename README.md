Hello!
======

My website is 100% open source, and anyone is welcome to view/use parts of my code in their own site as long as credit is given. You don't need to add uneccesary extras to you site/or code of mine you've used from _this project_ but at a minimum in the visible comments (Ex. html/css comments)  
  
  
This is is viewable at _(not at the moment)_: [http://williamhastings.me](http://williamhastings.me)  
It is built on the [GoHugo](http://gohugo.io/) static site generate, and themed using [Bootstrap V4](https://getbootstrap.com/)  

Not much more to say, so here is a image of the homepage:
