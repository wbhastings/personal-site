&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first post on my new site. I don't have much to write about yet, but let me tell you a bit about myself. I am a Undergrad student at the _University of Arizona_, and I am studying Computer Science. I am currently a Junior in the degree track, and have added a _Math_, and _Physics_ minor to degree.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alright, this is all fine and well, but you don't know I actually enjoy doing. I have multiple hobbies besides programming. For example I love to go explore the outdoors on my 2 dirtbikes. I own a _2004 Kawasaki KX250 M2_, and a _2006 Honda CRF250R_. I also love to bicycle, even though I find the thrill of wrapping my self around a 2 wheeled fire breathing machine. I ride in the _El Tour de Tucson_, and do so part of the _Juvenile Diabetes Research Group_ to raise money to help find a cure for other people like me who have Type 1 Diabetes.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, *yes*, I am a Type 1 Diabetic. I was diagnosed May 2nd, 2016 (So just over a year now), and I have yet to let this disease stop me. A lot of people don't realize that you can still get diagnosed with this Autoimmune disease as a young adult. I was diagnosed at the age of 23 for example.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, that's the gist of it. I'm over all a simple person, and like to explore new things. Using [GoHugo](http://gohugo.io)'s static site generator has been an interesting way to create my website staticly, but still have a way to manage my content. For those don't know what a static site is, it's just a website that does not have to be generated each page load (For example, a Wordpress, or Drupal site). It has it's advantages, and disadvantages, but it does what I need it to do. Plus, it was a great way to expose my self to #goLang, and to expand my understanding of Markdown, and HTML/CSS/Javascript. I hope you enjoy my site as much as I do!
