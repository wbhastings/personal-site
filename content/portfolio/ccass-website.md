Hired as a student employee at the _Institute of the Environment_, which is a research institute part of the University of Arizona. I work on websites with a team of people. Including a design team and 2 other co-workers where we either created new sites, or designed face lifts for them. CCASS (Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions) being one of them. I did page templating, content managment/structure, and a big chunk of the page styling in SASS ([http://sass-lang.com/](http://sass-lang.com/)).
