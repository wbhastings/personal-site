	<h1>Random Ramblings</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>Every once in a while as a Type 1 Diabetic (T1D), or as a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Arizona I feel the need to ramble on about something that happened or I learned that I found really cool, and I want to share. If you like reading that kind of thing, then you're in the right place! Never know, you might find something interesting or useful.</p>
